# cabal new-build
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: p (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: p-1.0 (not buildable in the current environment)
[__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: p)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: p (2)
