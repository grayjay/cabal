type Weight = Double

-- | Type of the search tree. Inlining the choice nodes for now. Weights on
-- package, flag, and stanza choices control the traversal order.
--
-- The tree can hold additional data on 'Done' nodes (type 'd') and choice nodes
-- (type 'c'). For example, during the final traversal, choice nodes contain the
-- variables that introduced the choices, and 'Done' nodes contain the
-- assignments for all variables.
--
-- TODO: The weight type should be changed from [Double] to Double to avoid
-- giving too much weight to preferences that are applied later.

    -- * For each choice we additionally record the 'QGoalReason' why we are
    --   introducing that goal into tree. Note that most of the time we are
    --   working with @Tree QGoalReason@; in that case, we must have the
    --   invariant that the 'QGoalReason' cached in the 'PChoice', 'FChoice'
    --   or 'SChoice' directly below a 'GoalChoice' node must equal the reason
    --   recorded on that 'GoalChoice' node.

-- | A package option is a package instance with an optional linking annotation
--
-- The modular solver has a number of package goals to solve for, and can only
-- pick a single package version for a single goal. In order to allow to
-- install multiple versions of the same package as part of a single solution
-- the solver uses qualified goals. For example, @0.P@ and @1.P@ might both
-- be qualified goals for @P@, allowing to pick a difference version of package
-- @P@ for @0.P@ and @1.P@.
--
-- Linking is an essential part of this story. In addition to picking a specific
-- version for @1.P@, the solver can also decide to link @1.P@ to @0.P@ (or
-- vice versa). It means that @1.P@ and @0.P@ really must be the very same package
-- (and hence must have the same build time configuration, and their
-- dependencies must also be the exact same).
